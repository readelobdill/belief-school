           I believe in you. There is not a thing you can say that would make me doubt that you can live YOUR best life.

                    <p>Each module is designed to help you catch sight of your potential. You can skim through the program, pick up a few tips and tricks that will definitely help.</p>

                    <p>At times you may find it emotionally challenging, other times almost too simple. Do not be tempted to skim over sections or think that a module doesn’t apply to you. Each module has been meticulously thought out and tested to help you develop a true sense of who you are.</p>

                    <p>Belief School has eight modules, plus some extras; you can complete each module immediately or take as long as you need. The next module will not unlock until you have completed the previous module, or for a minimum of 48 hours.</p>

                    <p>To complete each module you will need to create something, or take some action in your world.</p>

                    <p><b>We can’t impress upon you enough, pushing yourself with each module and feeling a little (or a lot) out of your comfort zone is what will create the biggest shifts in your awareness and your growth.</b></p>
