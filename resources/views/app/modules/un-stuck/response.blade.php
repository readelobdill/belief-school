            This is just the beginning of your own personal journey - writing out your limiting beliefs may seem daunting but we are about to turn those negative thoughts around with affirmation!
        </p>

        <div class="dots"></div>

        <h1 class="plain">
            What are affirmations?
        </h1>

        <p>
            <strong>Affirmations are the thoughts and words that we use every day.</strong> Negative affirmations are words that we tell ourselves that affirm negative emotions, words of anger, fear worry and negativity. Positive affirmations are words that are optimistic, joyful, hopeful and loving.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Our thoughts create our lives, when we use affirming thoughts this is what we bring into our lives.
        </blockquote>

        <p class="bold">
            It doesn’t matter what that answer was, it is either not true or an obstacle that can be overcome.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whatever those limiting beliefs are we are going to show you how to turn that negative chatter off and start to control the programing that is going on in your mind so it serves you rather than keeps you stuck.
        </p>

        <div class="dots"></div>

        <p>
            <strong>I want you to now work with the limiting beliefs that you identified and turn them into positive affirmations.</strong> You do this by crafting a positive statement (no negativity at all). This must be stated in the present like you already have this or are this.
        </p>

        <p>
            To create powerful affirming statements:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="multiple">
            <ul>
                <li>Look in the mirror when you say your affirmation and say it out loud with feeling.</li>
                <li>Say it as often as you can.</li>
                <li>Say it with emotion and picture it in your mind.</li>
                <li>Write your affirmations out and stick them in visible places, on your mirror, on the fridge, as your screen saver.</li>
                <li>As soon as you catch yourself dwelling on a limiting belief or negative thought, say your affirmation.</li>
                <li>Feel proud of this work, you are in the process of reprogramming your mind.</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Tak this limiting belief for example:</p>

        <blockquote class="dark">
            I’m hopeless with my kids I always lose it.
        </blockquote>

        <p>The affirmation would be:</p>

        <blockquote>
            I am amazing with my kids my first response is always gentle.
        </blockquote>
