            you really want?
        </h1>
        <p>Let's put it another way, what do you want if you believed you could be, do or have anything?</p>

        <p>Take a few minutes, what is that thought, that dream, that wish – yes the one you keep dismissing because you think it is not possible for you?</p>

        <p>What is the one thing you would love if there were no limitations, no obstacles – no fear?</p>

        <p><b>It’s a great idea to start a Belief School journal and explore these questions in more depth, for now write a concise answer here. No one is going to see this but you!</b> </p>
