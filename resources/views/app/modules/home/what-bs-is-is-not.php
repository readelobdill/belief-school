                <p><b>Simple.</b> A small amount of theory and a quick video to set you up for the task ahead.</p>
                <p><b>Game Changing.</b> You are having the experience, it is your reality and cannot be denied.</p>
                <p><b>Fun.</b> You’ll laugh a little and possibly cry a little, as you discover how special you are.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <p><b>Supportive.</b> Do this with a group, a team, or journey alone and reach out to the Belief School community. There will ALWAYS be someone to help you, recognise who you are, and give you a kick in the pants if you need it.
                </p>
                <p><b>Tried and True.</b> Each of these modules has been crafted out of hundreds of hours of study and from working with people one-on-one, we know how this goes.</p>

                <p>Like any other program on the planet. We are pretty confident this is one of a kind.</p>
                <p>Full of loads of theory and reading. New awareness and change can happen in an instant when we are presented with new evidence.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <p>Always easy. You can cruise through these modules not putting in much effort and even then you will create value for yourself. Or you can be brave and play full out – this is where the gold is.</p>
