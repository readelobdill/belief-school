        <p class="center"><b>Belief School is a fully automated online program</b> you can access from any device. Eight interactive modules, born out of thousands of face-to-face hours, each created to give you a framework to build confidence, solve problems and create your best results.</p>

        <p class="center"><b>Each module has approx. 15 minutes theory,</b> a short video, an optional audio coaching session (if you want greater depth) and an interactive online exercise.</p>

        <p class="center"><b>Each module is a stand-alone learning experience</b>—giving you a single principle to work with, an exercise that is very revealing and a lesson to take into your daily life.</p>

        <p class="center"><b>Each of the eight modules</b> are also connected and build on each other, creating more than their individual parts.</p>

        <p class="center"><b>As you progress through the program, you are building your live, dynamic Dashboard</b>—inputting content from you and your world. This is regularly updated as a rich resource and a reflection of your progress.</p>

        <p class="red-block center"><b>Upon completion, your Dashboard becomes your beautiful Belief School Manifesto.</b> A collection of all that you have created through this program, presented back to you as a downloadable product. It is a tool to use in times ahead and a reminder of the great value you bring to your world.</p>

        <p class="center"><b>Belief School is a community.</b> Whether you are connecting with people in our Forum, or through our Closed Facebook group, the Belief School Team and our past and present Belief Schoolers, are there to support you, cheer you on and shed a tear if needed.</p>
