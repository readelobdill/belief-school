        <p>Our intention is to give you the evidence you need to believe in yourself.</p>
        <p>Believing in your ability to create a happy, connected and abundant life, is the cornerstone of strong, beautiful relationships, abundance, success and being able to contribute to this crazy world we call humanity.</p>
        <p>Belief School is an investment in you, in your potential—your future. Upon completion you’ll have a tool box of principles and practises that are life changing—you are enough, we know it and we want you to know it.</p>

                <p><b>We are often acutely aware of our weakness,</b> but often unaware of our Strengths. Or we do not realise the value of our strengths. We are prone to making assumptions, with a distorted view of how we show up in our everyday lives.</p>
                <p><b>Do you know how awesome you are,</b> do you know what strengths you have that shine brightly?</p>
                <p><b>Your strengths are your unique combination of skills,</b> talents and personality traits that make you deliciously human; they are your force within.</p>

                <p><b>I’m too old, I’m not smart enough, that’s not possible for me, I’m useless at that, my family sucks;</b> as long as we keep saying this stuff to ourselves, we will continue to create it.</p>
                <p><b>We want self-talk that opens up all possibilities.</b> Learning to recognise negative self-talk and then change it is really important. Whatever limiting beliefs you hold, we will show you how to turn that negative chatter off, and create an internal conversational that focuses on what you want, not what you don’t want.</p>

                    This is one of my favourite Belief School exercises, with such a beautiful end product for you to keep.
                    Every time I have completed this with an individual or a group there is this wonderful glow, an understanding that happens when we shine our spotlight on the here and now. – Paula Gosney
