        <p>Our intention is to give you the evidence you need to believe in yourself.</p>
        <p>Believing in your ability to create a happy, connected and abundant life, is the cornerstone of strong, beautiful relationships, abundance, success and being able to contribute to this crazy world we call humanity.</p>
        <p>Belief School is an investment in you, in your potential—your future. Upon completion you’ll have a tool box of principles and practises that are life changing—you are enough, we know it and we want you to know it.</p>

            <h4 class="faq__question">Module One</h4>
            <div class="faq__answer">
                <p>We are often acutely aware of our weakness, but often unaware of our Strengths. Or we do not realise the value of our strengths. We are prone to making assumptions, with a distorted view of how we show up in our everyday lives.</p>
                <p>Do you know how awesome you are, do you know what strengths you have that shine brightly?</p>
                <p>Your strengths are your unique combination of skills, talents and personality traits that make you deliciously human; they are your force within.</p>
                <p>This first module alone has the potential to change your life. Using a unique blend of technology and real life experience, you complete an exercise that reveals your greatest qualities to you in a way that is deeply moving and cannot be denied.</p>

            <h4 class="faq__question">Module Two</h4>
            <div class="faq__answer">
                <p>When we change our words, we change our minds and then we change our outcomes.</p>
                <p>What we say to ourselves, is often negative at best, horrible at worst. It utterly defines how we feel, how we interact with others, and the choices we make.</p>
                <p>I’m too old, I’m not smart enough, that’s not possible for me, I’m useless at that, my family sucks; as long as we keep saying this stuff to ourselves, we will continue to create it.</p>
                <p>We want self-talk that opens up all possibilities. Learning to recognise negative self-talk and then change it is really important. Whatever limiting beliefs you hold, we will show you how to turn that negative chatter off, and create an internal conversational that focuses on what you want, not what you don’t want.</p>

            <h4 class="faq__question">Module Three</h4>
            <div class="faq__answer">
                <p>The vision, passion and strength needed to create the life you want comes from a foundation of self-confidence and self-belief. That platform is laid down not by things, but from the Love around you. The evidence of what you have already created and the feeling of being part of a community where you are valued.</p>
                <p>You are loved more than you realise, you have done more than you give yourself credit for, and you have people who believe in you greatly.</p>
                <p>With the clever use of technology you learn to surround yourself with this evidence, it’s game-changing and paradigm shifting!</p>

                    This is one of my favourite Belief School exercises, with such a beautiful end product for you to keep.
                    Every time I have completed this with an individual or a group there is this wonderful glow, an understanding that happens when we shine our spotlight on the here and now. – Paula Gosney

            <div class="faq__answer">
                <p>We wouldn’t be doing our job if we were not tackling the subject of fear. Learning to live a life where fear does not define your choices, changes everything.</p>
                <p>It is when you learn how to step through fear that you discover what you are truly capable of, your authenticity and creativity shines through, as does all the possibilities for your life.</p>
                <p>We understand fear; we know how to recognise the good fear from the bad and we know how to help you do the same. We use our core principles of community, accountability and recognition to set you up to discover your courage and to experience the incredible power of living without fear.</p>

            <div class="faq__answer">
                <p>Connection is <span class="underline">crucial</span> for self-belief and confidence. Most of what we do is driven by a deep desire to be part of a tribe. To be loved and accepted in our communities.</p>
                <p>In this module, we explore what this means for you. We look at the impact our actions have on those around us in a beautiful positive way. This module is all about creating a ripple effect that will bounce back to you in ways you cannot yet see.</p>
                <p>We promise from the top of head to the tips of our toes that this module and exercise will leave you smiling for days, with incredible “aha’s”, that will stay with you forever.</p>

            <div class="faq__answer">
                <p>Epigenetics is the new frontier of science; how our environment and our thoughts impact on the biochemistry of our body. Taking it a step further into the realm of quantum physics and we start to glimpse how what we believe, also impacts on the world around us.</p>
                <p>In this module, we explore how our biochemistry responds when we build our belief, confidence and connections. We introduce simple daily practices that will have a profound impact on your physical and emotional wellbeing.</p>
                <p>This is a rewarding process of reflection and actualisation that brings together all you have learnt and experienced in the last six modules.</p>

                <p>Planning and practise are essential if we are to continue to play to our strengths and incorporate new strategies into our daily lives.</p>
                <p>In module seven we introduce the five fundamental and essential processes required to take a “desire” into a personal reality.</p>
                <p>You can apply this to anything in your life: health, wealth, love, communication, exercise; the process of internalisation is all the same.</p>
                <p>In the context of Belief School, you’ll look at what has stood out for you the most during the program and work with those realisations.</p>
