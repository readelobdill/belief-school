            This week is fun! No mental workouts, just good old fashioned dreaming and appreciating what is fabulous in your life.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The task for this week is to create a virtual display of all the wonderful things in your life past and present. A collection of all the things in your world that you love, that inspire you, that remind you of what a brilliant individual you are. Things you have accomplished, people who lift you up and see the best in you.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>You will eventually choose a template and fill it with pictures, images and inspirational words</strong>, but first you'll have to hunt these items down.  To make things easier I've created three categories; start collecting so you get a fairly even number of items from each:
        </p>

        <div class="categories">
            <div class="category">
                <i>
                    @include('app/partials/icons/mod-3-cat-1')
                </i>
                <h3>Category #1</h3>
                <p>
                    Pictures of people (and pets) that you love dearly in this world and who love you. These people may have passed but still give you a profound sense of acceptance and love. Look for photographs that reflect those feelings. Whether they be a special time, or a look or smile.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="category">
                <i>
                    @include('app/partials/icons/mod-3-cat-2')
                </i>
                <h3>Category #2</h3>
                <p>
                    Pictures of things you have achieved that make you feel proud or remind you of a very special time. You may need to go and take a photo of that old trophy sitting on the shelf, or you uni degree, a love letter, a memento - as long as the image fills you with a sense of self love, pride and personal accomplishment.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="category">
                <i>
                    @include('app/partials/icons/mod-3-cat-3')
                </i>
                <h3>Category #3</h3>
                <p>
                    Pictures of people and things that inspire you deeply. Anything that pulls you forward in a significant emotional way. These can be anything from beautiful fierce tigers, to Mahmoud Ali or an incredible waterfall – this is your world, your mind, your reflection and inspiration.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="dots"></div>

        <h1 class="title">
            Beautiful you
        </h1>

        <p>
            <strong>In the centre find a picture of yourself.</strong> You’ll know the one, it makes you feel great inside. It doesn’t matter if you are 15 or 55, this picture must fill you with a strong feeling of self-love and a sense of your own personal power.
        </p>

        <p>
            This may take some finding, you may need to dig this out of old photos. <strong>This is very important, invest that energy into this exercise.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            If you really can’t find a photo, take one this week. But before you do, you must do whatever is necessary to fill your heart with happiness, wonder and excitement – sing, dance, walk down memory lane.
        </p>
