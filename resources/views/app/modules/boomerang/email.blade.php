        <p>Your friend has stepped out of {{$requiredModules['home']->data->{'1'}->gender === 'male' ? 'his' : 'her'}} comfort zone and sent you this email because {{$requiredModules['home']->data->{'1'}->gender === 'male' ? 'he' : 'she'}} values your opinion and trusts that you will answer the simple question honestly and with {{$requiredModules['home']->data->{'1'}->gender === 'male' ? 'his' : 'her'}}  best interest at heart.</p>


        <p>Clicking on the link will take you to a page on our Belief School website, youâ€™ll be asked to input three words that describe {{Auth::user()->first_name}}'s best qualities. The answers will be delivered to {{Auth::user()->first_name}} anonymously, mixed up with responses from friends, family and colleagues.</p>
