        <p>How we see ourselves in the world may not be how others see us. Often we are hard on ourselves, only focusing on our short comings and not celebrating the beautiful qualities other see in us and the way that we operate in the world. A lot of people are unaware of their strengths and so miss the opportunity to use these in the pursuit of their goals.</p>

            The belief school boomerang will help you build a picture of your strengths and endearing qualities.
