            On the other side of Fear is Courage
        </h1>

        <p>
            Facing our fear is essential to build personal belief. When our life is ruled by fear we do not live to our true potential. If we are making choices based on what other people will think, or whether we are afraid of success or failure – life is limited to the very small safe zone we have built up around us.

            It is the knee scraping that gives us depth, empathy and the ability to lead others. It is stretching for things that we are not sure we will reach that builds our belief and courage muscles.

        <p>
            It is here, when things feel the toughest that we really get to see what we are capable of. When we move from fear into courage our sense of personal power is extraordinary. When we act courageously even if the outcome wasn’t perfect we feel stronger, bigger and less afraid.

            This week it is action week. This week you are going to grab a big handful of courage and do some things you have been afraid to do.
        </p>

        <p>
            List below three things you have wanted to do but have been too afraid to. This is super personal: what is scary for one is a walk in the park for another. This might be as simple as cutting off your hair, inviting some friends over for dinner, trying out for a sports team, or as monumental as reaching out to someone you are estranged from, quitting your job or holding a big hairy spider in your hand.
        </p>

        <p class="bold">It doesn’t matter how big or small they are, they just need to be things that you _have not done because of some kind of fear. </p>



        <p class="center">
            You are going to do these three things this week...

            Have you written them down, or have you stalled right here?

        <p>
            If your mind is sifting through the things you are putting off, trying to work out which ones you are the least afraid of, searching for the ones that you are prepared to do... Stop!

            Put this in perspective. You may not get the exact outcome you wanted, but that doesn’t matter – this exercise is not about the outcome, it is about the action of not letting your fear control you.
