        <h2 class="title">Do you know how exceptional you are?</h2>

        <p class="center">We donâ€™t say this lightly. You chose to start Belief School. And, you <b class="red">FINISHED IT.</b></p>
        <p class="center"><strong>Who you have been throughout this program, is all you ever need to be throughout life.</strong></p>
        <p class="center"><strong>Brave, dedicated, compassionate and willing to learn.</strong></p>

        <p>You have given yourself a great gift of knowledge and experience. At the beginning of this program we talked about self-discipline; you have shown to yourself that you have the discipline you need to create your best life.</p>

        <p>If you apply this same commitment and willingness to learn, and you take the risks that you have done through each of the Belief School modules, You Can Do Anything.</p>

        <p>Do you get it? This is it. This is what it takes.</p>

        <h2 class="title"><strong>We are so Proud of you!</strong></h2>

        <p class="center"><strong>And we want you to be proud of yourself.</strong></p>

        <p>Right now you have your last exercise to complete. We want you to do it now while the emotion is high. This is really important, so put your heart and soul into it.</p>

        <p>Record a message from you, to you. This does not have to be slick or beautiful. It does have to be heartfelt and real.</p>

        <p>No one else ever has to see this if you want to keep it private, so leave nothing out.</p>

        <p>We promise you, there are times ahead when this message will be a super important gift to yourself.</p>

        <p>Look into the camera (not the screen) and no negative self talk at all.</p>

        <p>Tell yourself how much you believe in you and all the things you love about yourself. Celebrate the lovely words people have used to describe you, the love you have around you and the things you have already achieved. Tell yourself you are enough, that you deserve to live your best life.</p>
