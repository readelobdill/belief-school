            Now I want you to write yourself a letter<br>

            This Video is going to be very private and very special. There is not to be one negative word in this, not one, but or maybe, not one little self-put down, it is to cover the following:
        </p>

        <div class="video-details">
            <div class="detail">
                <span class="number">1 .</span>
                <p>
                    You are to tell yourself all the things you love about yourself, the qualities that you are most proud of.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="detail">
                <span class="number">2 .</span>
                <p>
                    You are to talk about your vision, the life you dream of, the things you want in your life and how they are going to make you feel when you have them.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="detail">
                <span class="number">3 .</span>
                <p>
                    You are going to end it by telling yourself that you believe in you!
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="video">
