        <p>Belief School is all about your experience. You have now seen many of the great qualities you possess – felt what it is like to face your fear, to contribute to others, and focus on the good around you.</p>

        <p>It’s now up to you to incorporate these principles into your daily life. This won’t happen automatically, you’ll have to make a conscious effort to develop these aspects of yourself.</p>

        <p>This process, starts with <b>Observation</b>, which you have just done.  </p>

        <p>Then you <b>Imitate</b> the new behaviour. This may seem unnatural at first. In fact you may feel like a fake, this is totally normal.  </p>

        <p>As you <b>Repeat</b> your new behaviour over and over, it starts to feel familiar. <b>Repetition and only repetition will create results.</b></p>

        <p>The results you create give you the evidence you need to build your belief. You have now <b>Internalised</b> this practice – it’s part of who you are.</p>

        <p>Choose to be a perpetual student of life, look to the people who have what you want and be humble enough to always learn.</p>

        <p>We have chosen these two movies for you to watch, both with very strong, important messages. If you have seen them, watch them again.</p>
