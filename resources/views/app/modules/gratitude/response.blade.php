        <p>Nice, you have taken the first step towards consciously incorporating gratitude into your life. Keep it up.</p>

        <p>The next part of this exercise is to express gratitude to someone else. A simple unexpected note of appreciation can have a big impact. It costs nothing but gives much.</p>

        <p>Think of someone who you’d like to express your thanks too. Open your email browser and send them an email now.</p>

                        I wanted to drop you a note to tell you how grateful I am for your friendship. I don’t tell you often, but you make such a difference in my life. You never make me feel stink if I can’t make something, and you are always so supportive of my ideas and adventures. I appreciate having you in my life so much and love that my kids get to see what real friendship is.<br>
                        Love me</em>
