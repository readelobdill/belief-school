            When we help others, when we contribute, we build our self-worth immensely. Often we are running so fast in the world trying to keep our heads above water, all our energy goes into the day to day management of our lives. It’s not that we don’t care, so often people think, we just don’t seem to have time or resources.
        </p>

        <p>
            The brilliant thing is, it works the other way around. When we make time to contribute, the universe kicks in and more of everything comes our way, including a great big serving of self-love and belief. There is no better feeling than when we contribute to making someone else’s life better.

            Who can you help this week

            We can bang on about facing our fear all day – it is meaningless unless we do it.

            Write down three things you can do this week to make someone else’s life better with absolutely zero expected back in return.

            It may be a one off deed or it may be the beginning of something long term. It can be as simple as bringing a meal to a friend in need, as public as standing on the side of the road collecting for the SPCA, or as close and personal as spending two hours building Lego with your son when there are a thousand other things to do.

            If your mind is sifting through the things you are putting off, trying to work out which ones you are the least afraid of, searching for the ones that you are prepared to do... Stop! Choose three things, choose them now, write them down now (declare them so you are held accountable) and commit to YOURSELF that you will do them this week, do the first one NOW. For the love of your amazing self, declare it to our community that has your back!
        </p>

        <p>Put this in perspective. You may not get the exact outcome you wanted, but that doesn’t matter.</p>

            This exercise is not about the outcome, it is about the action of not letting your fear control you.
